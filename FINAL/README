Authors:
Group 7 - Elvira, Rachel, Teresa, Abi.

Final versions of all of the code for Dead on The Dance Floor (adventure game) can be found here. 

All of the files for the text-based version of the game can be found in the folder "AdventureGame-TB-FINAL" 
Further information regarding the text-based and GUI versions of the game can be found in the description
of the folders. The text-based version and GUI version of the games share the same logic. However, they are
seperate interfaces (one for text,and one for GUI).

In order to run either games (text-based or GUI), please run the "Main" class to start.

How to Download and Run:
For the text-based version please download all files in the folder "AdventureGame-TB-Final" and run them from the Main
class.
For the GUI version please download all files in the folder "AdventureGame-GUI" and run them from the Main class.

Game Summary:
This is a murder mystery game where the user navigates through different scenes/locations and plays various
mini-games to discover clues. Once the user has collected all of the clues, they can arrest the murderer. Please
see the proposal file on D2L for more information on how the game works.

JUnit Tests:
The JUnit tests for TicTacToeTest, PoliceStationTest, LocationATest, LocationBTest, LocationCTest, LocationDTest can
be found in the folder for the text-based version of the game. These tests test the logic classes. 

Inheritance:
The inheritance can be found mostly in the parent class PoliceStation where the child classes are the various locations 
which share a toString method. To see this, please look at the Java files in the text-based version of the game.

Exceptions:
Exceptions can be found particularily in the sliding puzzle game in the GUI version of the game (please see the file). As well,
exceptions are found in the steal and talk button section of GUI.

References:
References for adapted code can be found in the Javadoc in each Java file if code was taken from a third party. Please read
the Javadoc for more information. Other references can be found in the "References" text file uploaded in this folder.
